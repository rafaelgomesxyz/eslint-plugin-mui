## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Contributions

1. **Start Small**: Begin with documentation or simple fixes to understand the codebase
2. **Validate AST Understanding**: Verify AI's understanding of AST structures
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always write tests for rule logic, don't rely only on AI's implementation
4. **Check for Edge Cases**: Ask AI to identify potential edge cases in rule implementation
5. **Review Existing Rules**: Use similar rules as a reference pattern

## Useful AI Prompts for Common Tasks

1. "Explain how the visitor pattern works in this ESLint rule"
2. "Help me identify edge cases for a rule that checks [specific pattern]"
3. "Suggest a fix function implementation for when [specific condition]"
4. "What AST node types should I check to detect [specific pattern]"
5. "How would you implement auto-fixing for [specific issue]"
